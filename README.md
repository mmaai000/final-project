## Web Design Trends
1. Dark Mode

2. Minimalism
   - Overview: Minimalism focuses on simplicity and the use of essential elements only. It aims to reduce clutter and create a clean, easy-to-navigate interface.
   - Implementation: The design will use ample white space, simple color schemes, and a limited number of fonts. Content will be organized in a way that highlights the most important information.

3. Micro-Interactions
   - Overview: Micro-interactions are small animations or feedback mechanisms that engage users and provide a sense of interaction with the interface. Examples include button animations, hover effects, and loading indicators.
   - Implementation: Micro-interactions will be incorporated using CSS animations and JavaScript. Examples include animated buttons, hover effects on images, and smooth transitions between pages.
